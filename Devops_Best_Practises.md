## Shell scripting 
1. **Use Indentation**
```
Indentation is an important part of making your code more readable and understandable. 
It can help you see the structure of your code at a glance and make it easier to follow.
```
2. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**
```
Using meaningful variable names can help make your code more readable and understandable.
It also makes it easier for others to maintain your code if they need to modify it in the future.
```
3. **Dont hard code the same values multiple times in the script, Instead use Variables to store the value and refer it where ever its required**
```
When creating shell scripts for automation, avoid hardcoding values such as IP addresses, file paths, or other system-specific details. 
Instead, use variables or configuration files to store and reference this information.
This will make the script more portable and easier to maintain in the future.
```
4. **Use Functions**
```
Functions are blocks of code that can be called multiple times from within a script. 
They help to keep the code organized and make it easier to maintain.
```
